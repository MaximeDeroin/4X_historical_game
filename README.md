# 4X historical game

This project is a [4X game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) with simplified mechanics.
The goal is to create a game playable in under one hour, while still retaining 
most of the aspects of a typical 4X game: 
* an early expansion phase, with exploration and strategical decisions,
* choices to expand and make progress through the ages,
* interaction with other players, like commerce, diplomacy, influence, conflict
* a feeling of progress and development.

## Current version
Currently, the project is in early development phase, so no playable version is available.

## Workflow
The project is still in the early phase, here is the workflow that will be followed:
### Git branches
The _main_ branche contains the last stable version of the game. Currently, no stable version has been released.
The main branch for each version is named after the version, with underscores separating the numbers. For example, 
the branch for the first version, _1.0_, is named [v_1_0](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/tree/v_1_0)

### Definition of a version
In the [issue list](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/issues) are listed all the requested features, with levels of precision

In the [milestone page](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/milestones), these issues are regrouped in versions. 

During the process of development, issues are coded on the version branch, and closed when they are finished. When all the issues of a milestone are 
completed, the code is merged in _main_ branch, with a label and a [release](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/releases).
