# 4X historical game

The project is still in the early phase, here is the workflow that will be followed:

## Workflow
### Git branches
The _main_ branche contains the last stable version of the game. Currently, no stable version has been released.
The main branch for each version is named after the version, with underscores separating the numbers. For example, 
the branch for the first version, _1.0_, is named [v_1_0](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/tree/v_1_0)

### Definition of a version
In the [issue list](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/issues) are listed all the requested features, with levels of precision

In the [milestone page](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/milestones), these issues are regrouped in versions. 

During the process of development, issues are coded on the version branch, and closed when they are finished. When all the issues of a milestone are 
completed, the code is merged in _main_ branch, with a label and a [release](https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/4X_historical_game/releases).
